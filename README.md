<h1 align="center">HTML CSS Review</h1>


<h2>Description:</h2>

Repo for reviewing basics of web development.


<h2>Goals/Purpose:</h2>

- This repo didn't have any main goals in particular, other than to review the basics of html, css, 
and bootstrap. However, the videos I was using to review bootstrap, I realized, were extremely outdated. 
I decided this would be a good opportunity to practice referencing/learning from documentation only 
what I need instead of the very common learning method of watching videos and reading articles "cover 
to cover" before actually making anything.

...other reasons for this repo:
- Practice and get used to making and connecting local repo to a github repo as soon as I start a project.
- Actually make commits, pushes, and pulls throughout project instead of making a single commit that 
holds the entire project after it's already done.
- Use the popular and highly beloved VSCode IDE for the first time (have used PyCharm, Atom, Brackets, 
Sublime, and Jupyter Notebooks before.


<h3>Note:</h3>

- Bootstrap was reviewed/relearned via a mini-project in another repo (Generic-Overzealous-Startup-Project).
